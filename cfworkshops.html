      <h2><b>Workshop on Dependable Computing for Complex Systems</b></h2>
      <p><b>Website:</b> <a href="https://www.dccs2025.com/">https://www.dccs2025.com/</a></p>
      <p><b>Description:</b></p>
      <p>In the era of Industry 4.0, software applications, such as cyber-physical systems (CPS), server systems,
        machine learning-based systems, databased systems, and real-time systems, are playing an increasingly important
        role in both industrial world and our daily lives. These systems tend to be composed of many different
        components which may interact with each other and exhibit complex behaviors. Also, in these systems,
        dependability is critical, as failures or requirement violations of these systems may lead to disruptive
        results, even the loss of human lives. Nowadays, extensive studies, including both formal methods and
        engineering techniques, have been conducted, aiming to improve the systems’ safety, reliability,
        maintainability, availability, etc. However, for complex systems, the gap between the huge number of interacting
        components and the salability of current approaches still exists. Nevertheless, we believe the demand of
        dependable complex systems motivates the development of novel techniques or feasible adaptations of existing
        techniques, through addressing more issues such as components’ interactions or real-time scheduling. DCCS seeks
        to provide an international venue to discuss the advanced discoveries and emerging trends related to the
        dependability of complex systems in both the academic society and industrial world. This workshop will not only
        explore how we can apply the emerging dependability theories and techniques to model and evaluate the complex
        systems, but also the methods or tools for localizing and fixing the system vulnerabilities to improve the
        system dependability.</p>

      <h2><b>Workshop on Dependable and Secure Machine Learning</b></h2>
      <p><b>Website:</b> <a href="https://dependablesecureml.github.io/">https://dependablesecureml.github.io/</a></p>
      <p><b>Description:</b></p>
      <p>Machine learning (ML) is increasingly used in critical domains such as health and wellness, criminal sentencing
        recommendations, commerce, transportation, human capital management, entertainment, space technology, and
        communication. The design of ML systems has mainly focused on developing models, algorithms, and datasets on
        which they are trained to demonstrate high accuracy for specific tasks such as object recognition and
        classification. ML algorithms typically construct a model by training on a labelled training dataset, and their
        performance is assessed based on the accuracy in predicting labels for unseen (but often similar) testing data.
        This is based on the assumption that the training dataset is representative of the inputs that the system will
        face in deployment. However, in practice, there are many unexpected accidental, and adversarially-crafted
        perturbations on the ML inputs that might lead to violations of this assumption. ML algorithms are also often
        over-confident about their predictions when processing such unexpected inputs. This makes it difficult to deploy
        them in safety-critical settings where one needs to rely on the ML predictions to make decisions or revert to a
        failsafe mode. Further, ML algorithms are often executed on special-purpose hardware accelerators, which could
        be subject to faults and attacks. Thus, there is a growing concern regarding the reliability, safety, security &
        privacy, and accountability of ML-assisted systems.</p>

      <h2><b>Workshop on Safety and Security of Intelligent Vehicles </b></h2>
      <p><b>Website:</b> <a href="https://sites.google.com/icmc.usp.br/ssiv">https://sites.google.com/icmc.usp.br/ssiv</a></p>
      <p><b>Description:</b></p>
      <P>Over the last years, aerial and ground vehicles as well as mobile robot systems have been receiving an
        increased number of electronic components, connected through wireless networks and running embedded software.
        This strong integration between dedicated computing devices and the physical environment, composes a
        Cyber-Physical System (CPS). CPS have thus become part of common vehicles, accessible to everyone, such as
        automobiles or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Furthermore, as processing power increases and software becomes
        more sophisticated, these vehicles gain the ability to perform complex operations, becoming more autonomous,
        efficient, adaptable, comfortable, safe and usable. These are known as Intelligent Vehicles (IV).</p>

      <P>As processing capabilities and software sophistication continue to advance, these vehicles are evolving into
        more autonomous, efficient, adaptable, comfortable, safe, and usable entities. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),
        in particular, are offering flexible support for diverse missions, enabling deployment in scenarios that were
        previously challenging or inaccessible. This is achieved through seamless integration with sensor networks
        capable of monitoring a wide range of applications. On the road, automobiles now provide features such as active
        safety, adaptive cruise control, park assistance, automatic climate control, navigation support, and, in the
        near future, vehicle-to-vehicle communication. With networking capabilities, the myriad of devices within
        vehicles are seamlessly integrated into the Internet of Things (IoT) landscape.</p>

      <P>Given their potential impact on human lives and high-value assets, these systems are classified as critical.
        Safety emerges as a paramount concern for both developers and users. However, the combination of high mobility
        and wireless communications has further increased the exposure of such systems to malicious threats and to
        faults deriving from uncertain connectivity or communication timeliness. Non-functional requirements like
        security and real-time operation have thus become harder to fulfill, creating new challenges to these
        safety-critical embedded systems. The environment of humans will continue to evolve to interactive IoT that is
        going to include mobile (flying, driving, floating, rolling, diving, walking, etc) objects that raise numerous
        challenging issues. Observing the current trend in the development of self-driving cars, one can only infer that
        artificial intelligence (through machine learning) is going to play a crucial role in future intelligent
        vehicles. However, the complexity of such algorithms decreases their level of trust and integrating them in
        critical systems is a far-reaching research issue. Although advanced hardware components like multi-core
        processors, GPUs, or FPGAs are a formidable opportunity to deploy complex functionalities in intelligent
        vehicles, they raise new challenges for certification, verification of real-time properties, safety, and
        security.</p>

      <P>This milestone marks the remarkable tenth edition of the workshop, a testament to the enduring success and
        impact cultivated through the preceding events. As we embark on this historic edition, it becomes increasingly
        apparent that the landscape of challenges in ensuring Safety and Security in Intelligent Vehicles, whether
        connected to the Internet or not, is expanding at an unprecedented pace. The wealth of open challenges
        underscores the critical need for sustained research initiatives and in-depth discussions on these matters—a
        need that has gained momentum and resonance on a global scale. As we celebrate a decade of collective effort,
        the 10th edition serves as a poignant reminder of the continuous evolution and significance of our shared
        commitment to advancing the field.</p>

      <P>Therefore, the workshop will keep its focus on exploring the challenges and interdependencies between security,
        safety, real-time, and certification/standards, which emerge when introducing networked, autonomous, and
        cooperative functionalities. SSIV aims at joining together in an active debate, researchers, and practitioners
        from several communities, namely dependability and security, real-time and embedded systems, intelligent
        transportation, and mobile robot systems.</p>

      <p>A non-exhaustive list of topics of interest include the following:
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Architecture, design, implementation, and management of safe and secure intelligent vehicles</li>

      <h2><b>Workshop on the Verification & Validation of Dependable Cyber-Physical Systems</b></h2>
      <p><b>Website:</b> <a href="https://verdi-workshop.github.io/2025/">https://verdi-workshop.github.io/2025/</a></p>
      <p><b>Description:</b></p>
      <p>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are a class of engineering systems where computation and
        communication interact with physical processes, providing complex, situation-aware, and often
        safety-, security-, or mission-critical ecosystems and services. The fast increase and availability of
        communication bandwidth and computational power, as well as emerging computing paradigms
        such as Cloud Computing, Edge Computing, and Deep Learning, are pushing forward CPS research
        and development, and establishing them as promising engineering solutions to address
        challenges arising in areas as diverse as aerospace, automotive, energy, disaster response, health
        care, smart farming, manufacturing, city management, among others.</p>

      <p>A key property that CPS are expected to exhibit is that of dependability, that is, the ability to
        provide services that can be trusted within well determined time-periods, and equally important,
        that those service guarantees hold even when the system is subject to faults and attacks. A key
        ingredient to ensure dependability is thus to successfully apply verification & validation (V&V)
        techniques and attest the desired levels of safety, security, and privacy. Here V&V refers to the
        process of determining whether the requirements for a system or component are complete and
        correct, the products of each development phase fulfil the requirements or conditions imposed
        by the previous phase, and the final system or component complies with the specified
        requirements.1 This is a challenging task that comes with significant time and cost implications
        for all the organizations involved in the build-up and evaluation of CPS. This challenge becomes
        even more demanding with the incorporation of more and more AI components (software and
        hardware) enabled by the notion of Compute Continuum into the operational capabilities of CPS
        for handling tasks that are increasingly complex.</p>

      <p>The VERDI workshop aims at serving as a discussion forum focused on the area of V&V as a means
        to guarantee dependability of complex, potentially automated/autonomous CPS. We welcome
        submissions in IEEE two-column conference style in two formats: short papers (up to 4 pages)
        and full papers (up to 8 pages). The workshop covers all aspects related to the dependability
        evaluation (with special focus on <b>safety</b> and <b>security</b>) of safety-critical CPS using techniques such
        as <i>fault/attack-injection, static and/or dynamic formal verification, semi-formal analysis,
        simulation, and testing</i>. Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Safety/security risk assessment and assurance</li>
        <li>Analysis of threats and vulnerabilities</li>
        <li>In-the-loop and model-based analysis and assessment</li>
        <li>Architecture-driven assurance of safety and security</li>
        <li>Interplay between safety and security</li>
        <li>Tools for validation and verification</li>
        <li>Dependability analysis using simulation and experimental measurement</li>

    to draw the attention of the research community to the problem of
    establishing guarantees of reliability, security, safety, and robustness
    for systems that incorporate increasingly complex ML models, and to the
    challenge of determining whether such systems can comply with requirements
    for safety-critical systems. A further goal is to build a research
    community at the intersection of machine learning and dependable and secure
